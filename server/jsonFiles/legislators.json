She lived in northern Denmark for a year as a Rotary Youth Ambassador, then arrived in Utah to begin her freshman year at BYU. Awed by Utah's scenic beauty and its wonderful people, she takes enormous pride in her adopted home state.     After graduating from BYU with a B.A. in English, Cheryl worked as a law librarian while her husband finished graduate school. She has also worked for the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Defense, where she earned the Meritorious Service Award. She has been a freelance writer and editor, an independent contractor, an internet researcher, a newspaper reporter, and a classroom volunteer, but in her heart, she has always been a teacher.      Cheryl and her husband, Scott, have occupied the same home in West Jordan for 28 years. Over an 11-year span touching three decades and two millennia (1989-2000), they had two sons and two daughters. As a family, they accomplished the goal of traveling together to all 50 states.     Representative Acton has many hobbies and interests, including writing, traveling, current events, history, quote collecting, and photography. She is endlessly fascinated by people, nature, and animals.     Cheryl was motivated to run for office by a desire to restore and preserve freedom, which, in her view, has been eroding over her lifetime. Cheryl believes in the worth and dignity of individuals and families and their right and ability to govern their own affairs. She also believes that, for the good of the Republic, civility, wit, and wisdom must return to politics.     Representative Acton believes that while other elected titles (senator, governor, etc.) have lost their original meaning, \"Representative\" is unambiguous. It describes perfectly her role as a voice for the people of District 38.","address":"350 N State Street, Ste. 350, Salt Lake City, UT, 84114","email":"cacton@le.utah.gov","cell":"801-809-3571","committees":[{"committee":"APPCRI","name":"Criminal Justice Appropriations Subcommittee"},{"committee":"HSTHHS","name":"House Health and Human Services Committee"},{"committee":"HSTJUD","name":"House Judiciary Committee"},{"committee":"INTHHS","name":"Health and Human Services Interim Committee"},{"committee":"INTJUD","name":"Judiciary Interim Committee"},{"committee":"INTRIE","name":"Retirement and Independent Entities Interim Committee"}],"legislation":"https://le.utah.gov/asp/billsintro/RepResults.asp?Listbox3=ACTONCK","demographic":"https://le.utah.gov/Documents/demographic/profiles/2022/House_Dist38.pdf","CofI":[{"url":"https://le.utah.gov/house2/CofI/COFIACTONCK1.pdf"},{"url":"https://le.utah.gov/house2/CofI/COFIACTONCK.pdf"},{"url":"https://le.utah.gov/house2/CofI/ACTONCK2.pdf"},{"url":"https://le.utah.gov/house2/CofI/ACTONCK1.pdf"}],"FinanceReport":[{"url":"https://disclosures.utah.gov/Search/PublicSearch/FolderDetails/1414828"}]},{"fullName":"Ivory, Ken","formatName":"Ken Ivory","id":"IVORYK","image":"https://le.utah.gov/images/legislator/IVORYK.jpg","house":"H","party":"R","district":"39","serviceStart":"January 1, 2011","profession":"Attorney","professionalAffiliations":"Sandy Chamber of Commerce, West Jordan Chamber of Commerce, Sandy Rotary Club, Sandy Honorary Colonels Association","education":"J.D.
